    description: '"Spring 2022 marks 15 years since pressing and cutting my first skateboard. I\'m still doing it by hand, in backyards, garages, sheds, and basements. My tools will be with me on the road as I spend most of the summer out west. Thank\'s for the continued support of this sweet hobby, I hope to see you out in a park, carving some ditches, bombing a hill, or cruising along the coast." - Shain Gleba',
